I just move all the source about daily English here.

eg. math.md  comes from the typora note

eg. ielstS.md comes from the ipad, when I listen to the xiaomi phone the take note in the ipad. Then if there is a network connection, I will copy the note to the github, to this file

eg. help, every help I need some note to make the timeline very clear!!
