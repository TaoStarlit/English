    - unit 21 22, give you some tips on learning new words.
    - you can work through the units 1-20 in any order. it is best to work through a unit from beginning to end as one exercise
    - unit 23 - 25 focus on writing -> good for the 7 days writing book
    - worklist: it is an good idea to study the wordlist before you begin each unit; use this wordlist as a test or review at the end of each unit. Understand these words when you read or hear them. You should also try to extend your active vocabulary by using them in your writing and speaking tasks.
    - how to do the writing test: the model answers could be used as **a guide to organising ideas and using vocabulary accurately and effetively**. But please don't copy it in the real test, or you will be penalised.

    - 20 units  LSRW all cover. learning this, and use it in the advanced writing, use them correctly
