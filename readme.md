I just move all the source about daily English here.

eg. math.md  comes from the typora note

eg. ielstS.md comes from the ipad, when I listen to the xiaomi phone the take note in the ipad. Then if there is a network connection, I will copy the note to the github, to this file

## the list of book I borrow from the library:
1. advanced writing step-by-step (only 7 day) top-priority
2. BBC speak-out intermediate student book-- copy the CD
3. cambridge vocabulary for IELTS-- copy the CD
    - CD is for pronunciation part
    - learning new words through listening and reading in context. the book also gives you opportunities to pracitse new words so that can become part of your **active word**.
    - unit 21 22, give you some tips on learning new words.
    - you can work through the units 1-20 in any order. it is best to work through a unit from beginning to end as one exercise
    - unit 23 - 25 focus on writing -> good for the 7 days writing book
    - worklist: it is an good idea to study the wordlist before you begin each unit; use this wordlist as a test or review at the end of each unit. Understand these words when you read or hear them. You should also try to extend your active vocabulary by using them in your writing and speaking tasks.
    - how to do the writing test: the model answers could be used as **a guide to organising ideas and using vocabulary accurately and effetively**. But please don't copy it in the real test, or you will be penalised. 
4.  Ielst listen -- copy the CD
5.  vocabulary in use -- long term no CD, but you should read it more time (revise) -- with the conversation
    - with picture, it is very good to learn new word
6. phrasal verbs in use -- long time - with the conversation
7. primary grammar
8. the IELST speaking (old one) comb by my self

your time -- 8pm school: speak out or ielts
9pm home: discuss with chen  
10:30 pm: study by yourself  

so revise vocabulary, phrasal vocabulary -- home
