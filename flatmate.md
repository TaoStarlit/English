Hi xx, I would like to visit the University of Sydney this week. But to not be as you mentioned that going to a new place alone will be sad, boring and lonely, it'd be better if you can be the tour guide. When do you have time at your University?

political poll; the accuracy of this endeavor; xxx is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admission.

there are a lot of reasons why political polling has become so inaccurate.

- for a pollster/ pollsters.  representative
our societies have become really diverse, which makes it difficult for pollsters to get really nice representative samples of the population of their poll.

what are the 3 ways?  sample, visualize(mean, scale), how was the data collected (define the certain term)

- a huge insterest in doing, need doing sth
private companies don't have a huge insterest in getting the numbers right. They just need the right numbers.
- crucial, cruel, anecdote
On the one hand, there are those who say these statistics are crucial, that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [objective] way.



- elitist oOost;  elite: oOo
favoring, advocating, or restricted to an elite.
- advocate:
a person who publicly supports or recommends a particular cause or policy.
eg. he was an untiring advocate of economic reform.


Right now there's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality.
congress: the national legislative body of a country.

segregation; let alone: quit an easy thing, let alone another difficult one
The draft law says that government money should not be used to collect data on racial segregation. This is a total disaster. If we don't have this data, how can we observe discrimination, let alone fix it?

In other words: How can a government create fair policies if they can't measure current levels of unfairness?

- legislate: make or enact laws.
How can we legislate on health care if we don't have good data on health or poverty? How can we have public debate about immigration if we can't at least agree on how many people are entering and leaving the country? Statistics come from the state; that's where they got their name. The point was to better measure the population in order to better serve it.

- move beyond A. We need to xx be able to do B
So we need these government numbers, but we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting or blindly rejecting them. We need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics.
- rarely got the chance
the one group of people who could really tell us were the Iraqis, and they rarely got the chance to find our analysis, let alone question it.
- geek(an unfashionable or socially inept person.) nerd(foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious) word used by people who say themselves are smart, but humble ?? every one can do that.
So I became a data journalist. My job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public. Anyone can do this, you don't have to be a geek or a nerd. You can ignore those words(geek/nerd); they're used by people trying to say they're smart while pretending they're humble. Absolutely anyone can do this.

- Q1: uncertainty
  Let's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor.
  average value has no meaning in representing all population. eg. swiming pool
- Q2: Can I see your self in data
Let's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor.
- Q3: how was the data collected
eg. one term, different definitions
- conclusion 
I get it, it's frustrating. If you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company, you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends, test it out, if it doesn't work, you can say the numbers were wrong. But how do you question government statistics? You just keep checking everything. Find out how they collected the numbers. Find out if you're seeing everything on the chart you need to see. But don't give up on the numbers altogether, because if you do, we'll be making public policy decisions in the dark, using nothing but private interests to guide us.
