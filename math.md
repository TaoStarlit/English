## spherical, Gaussian

In the Gaussian kernel model, the Gaussian shape is spherical and its width is control by a single bandwidth parameter \sigma, which is chosen by cross-validation.

## Bernoulli
Bernoulli distribution is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability $p$ and the value 0 with probability $q=1-p$

$$
P(x=k;p)=\left\{
\begin{aligned} 
& p,& k=1\\
& 1-p,& k=0
\end{aligned}    
    \right .
