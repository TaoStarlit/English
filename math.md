## 1 Linear System and Gaussian Elimilation
linear:
# exponent
An equation with one or more unknowns is called linear if the unknowns appear on their own, without exponent
## 2 Special Case
1. contradictory equation: no solution
2. irrelevant equation: the equation does not constrain the value of x in any way

(addition is commutative)
x+ (y+z) = (x+y) +z (addition is associative)
x ∗ y = y ∗ x (multiplication is commutative)
x ∗ (y ∗ z) = (x ∗ y) ∗ z (multiplication is associative)
x ∗ (y+z) = x ∗ y+x ∗ z (multiplication distributes over addition)
x ∗ (y+z) = x ∗ y+x ∗ z (multiplication distributes over addition)

## 3 Analytic Geometry in the plane
1. Cartesian Coordiante System
2. 2 axes, x-axis
3. coordinates
4. distance
5. vectors; straight line movement
6. unit vector, null vectoer
7. factor/scalar
8. representing straight lines (parametric representation + parameter): X=P+sv is called a parametric representation.   the parameter is s
9. Instersection two lines: the intersectino point satisfies: X=Y.  the parameter is the unknows. --> get the soltion --> s will tell us how far in the direction v *we have to move* from P in order to reac the point of intersection.
 Cartesian coordinate systems and points in the plane. Recall the idea of a coordinate system:

## spherical, Gaussian

In the Gaussian kernel model, the Gaussian shape is spherical and its width is control by a single bandwidth parameter \sigma, which is chosen by cross-validation.

## Bernoulli
Bernoulli distribution is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability $p$ and the value 0 with probability $q=1-p$

$$
P(x=k;p)=\left\{
\begin{aligned} 
& p,& k=1\\
& 1-p,& k=0
\end{aligned}    
    \right .
