### transitional, fringe, harsh, prolific, adaptations
Plan life in the XX(place)
Whant I *undertood* in the reading is that there *are't* a lot of plants throughout ...
.. in *the* transitional area on the desert *fringe*.

*conditions in the desert are extremely harsh*, but around the edges, plants have been able to adapt and thrive, and some species are actually quite prolific.
the plants have some interesting adaptations.

### stressor, sparse, is subject to, swing,
There are still a lot of stressors on the desert fringe. The rain there is sparse, right?

the derset is subject to extreme termperature swings, and these condition can cause plants a lot of stress.

### dry air->rapid evaporation,  hold on to <- take in, pore, be able to and have the ability to, accumulate .<- taken from
becase of the dry air, there's rapid evaporation, so it is difficult for the plant to hold on to the water they take in.

I *read some plants are actually* able to  determine when they've lost enough moisture and have the ability to close their pores so they don't lose more.

.. so they can accumulate water taken from the deep in the groud.
