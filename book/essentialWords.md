## AudioScript-1 The environmental impact of logging (lecturer)
### terrestrial, aquatic, trail, variety, beneath the bark, owls, squirrels, on the branches or in the trunk, erode 
When you look at ..,you may notice only... A closer look shows there is a great deal more going on. ... a large variety of terrestrial animals, from tiny insects to large birds such as owls. Insects live beneath the bark, providing a source of food for many types of birds. Squirrels and birds nest on the branches or in the trunk. Small animals defend themselve by hiding among the leaves. The benefit of trees also extend to aquatic aninmals. The shade from trees keeps water cool, protecting the aquatic animals from the heat of the summer sun. The roots hold on to the soil, which keep it from being eroded by the rain. This is a protection for aquatic habitats, as it prevents the soil running into the rivers and polluting them. Clearly, trees are very important. If the forests vanish because of the logging or other activities, the impact on environment will be great.
#### what you missed 
1. closer , not close + a/your.  shows ==> so the subject is the look
2. a variety of animals , not a variety kinds of
3. sentence, doing ... a comma before doing
4. themselves, among
5. s, countable or not?   verb+s ==> the subject is singular or uncountable
6. sentence | if + clause |sentence ==> the period should be in the 2nd |


## AudioScript-2 Bird Migration (tour guide)
### Sanctuary, migratory, nocturnal, autumn, trail, imperative, stray off, restricted, forbbiden, disturbance, feat
.. the Bird Sanctuary provides us with the opportunty to study many acspects of the lives of the migratory birds that pass through here every year. This is a breeding area... we'll likely see the a number on our walk today. On our right, just pass the entrance, I'll see a list of all the species .. I will see several nocturnal species as well as diurnal. They spend the warm months here, but leave in autumn, as they can not endure our cool winters. .... it's imperative you are not stray off the trail, your are particularly careful to stay out of the restricted area, all along the trail to left here. The restricted area protects breeding bird from disturbance. ... But before we head there, let's contiune to the end of this trail on the left, to the observation platform. ... You can look out over the wetlands from here to observe the waterbirds. I will leave you here to observe as long as you like. And I will meet you afterward at the gift ship. ... I can imagine what a feat that was, and what it takes to maintain it. .. Please consider giving your donation. You will find the box for that purpose along the trail right before you arrive at the gift shop.
### what I missed
1. yearly behavior --> simple present tense, not past
2. introduce at 1st time --> a breeding area, not the
3. prediction --> will likely do, not would like to, (desire)
4. on/ off, stray off the trail
5. for before, there/here, head there
6. comma, to xx of on xx, to xx
7. aftetward, afterwards
8. in /at , at the gift shop
9. the / that, having mention donation, for that purpose
10. trail: a route followed for a particular purpose


## AudioScript-3
- Relating to or characteristic of a process or period of transition
- The action of process of adapting or being adapting  [vocabulary][https://github.com/TaoStarlit/English/blob/master/book/vocabularyIELTS.md]
Plan life in the XX(place)
### transitional, fringe, harsh, prolific, adaptations
What I *understood* in the reading is that there *are't* a lot of plants throughout ...
.. in *the* transitional area on the desert *fringe*.

*conditions in the desert are extremely harsh*, but around the edges, plants have been able to adapt and thrive, and some species are actually quite prolific.
the plants have some interesting adaptations.

### stressor, sparse, is subject to, swing,
There are still a lot of stressors on the desert fringe. The rain there is sparse, right?

the desert fringe is subject to extreme termperature swings, and these conditions can cause plants a lot of stress.

### dry air->rapid evaporation,  hold on to <- take in, pore, be able to and have the ability to, accumulate .<- taken from
becase of the dry air, there's rapid evaporation, so it is difficult for the plant to hold on to the water they take in.

I *read some plants are actually* able to  determine when they've lost enough moisture and have the ability to close their pores so they don't lose more.

.. so they can accumulate water taken from the deep in the ground.

#### missed
1. rapid evaporatin
2.

#### word definition
1. aquatic: relating to water; living in the water
2. erosion: loss of soil from action fo water or wind
3. deforestation: the removal of all trees from a large area 
4. logging: the cutting down of tree for commercial purposes
4. intercept: to catch
5. inhibit: to prevent, slow down   eg. tree inhibit soil erosion
6. myriad: many, numerous
7. vegetation: plants on a area

1. fasinate: Bird migration in particular has fascinated observers for centuries.(to interest greatly)
2. biological, imperative, niches: Migration is an example of how nature has responded to the biological imperative for species to evolve and spread out into all possible ecological niches.
3. Hemisphere: Migration of this type takes place primarily into the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. (one half of the Earth; also, one half of a sphere)
4. arctic, antarctic: The tern breeds in the arctic regions and winters in antarctic water.
5. latitude: they travel to higher latitudes to breed during the warm season.
6. exhibit: some species exhibit altitudinal migration: their breeding areas are near or at the peak, and they spend their nonbreeding season in neighboring valley.
7. feat: modern researchers have attempted to understand this feat - unerringly travel (difficult act or achievement) 
8. obscure: The nocturnal birds may stop flying when clouds obscure the sky (to make difficult to see)
9. stray: to leave the correct route; become separated from the group

1. dilute: it takes in unlimited amounts of salt through the roots, up the stem, and into leaves, where it dilutes the normally toxic salt by increasing the number and volume of its cells (to make weaker by mixing with water)
2. resilient: Successful desert plants are resilient to sorching summers and frigid winters. (tough, able to endure difficult conditions)  Desert plants are resilient to heat and dryness.
3. swing: Sparse rainfall, daily temperature swings of up to 20C, and (a sudden or big change) + The children played on the swing all afternoon (back-and-forth movement) + The swing of the branches in the breeze made a creaking noise (a hanging set moves back and forth)
4. violent: (strong, sudden and destructive)violent sandstorms make it one of the most extreme environments on earth
