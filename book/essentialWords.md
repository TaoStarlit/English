## AudioScript-1 The environmental impact of logging (lecturer)
### terrestrial, aquatic, variety, beneath the bark, owls, squirrels, on the branches or in the trunk, erode 
When you look at ..,you may notice only. A closer look shows there is a great deal more going on. ... a large variety of terrestrial animals, from tiny insects to large birds such as owls. Insects live beneath the bark, providing a source of food for many types of birds. Squirrels and birds nest on the branches or in the trunk. Small animals defend themselve by hiding among the leaves. The benefit of trees also extend to aquatic aninmals. The shade from trees keeps water cool, protecting the aqutic animals from the heat of the summer sun. The roots hold on to the soil, which keep it from being eroded by the rain. This is a protection for aquatic habitats, as it prevents the soil running into the rivers and polluting them. Clearly, trees are very important. If the forests vanish because of the logging or other activities, the impact on environment will be great.

You can look out over the wetlands from here to observe the waterbirds. I will leave you here to observe as long as you like. And I will meet you afterward at the gift ship. ...

## AudioScript-3
### transitional, fringe, harsh, prolific, adaptations
- Relating to or characteristic of a process or period of transition
- The action of process of adapting or being adapting  [vocabulary][https://github.com/TaoStarlit/English/blob/master/book/vocabularyIELTS.md]
Plan life in the XX(place)
Whant I *understood* in the reading is that there *are't* a lot of plants throughout ...
.. in *the* transitional area on the desert *fringe*.

*conditions in the desert are extremely harsh*, but around the edges, plants have been able to adapt and thrive, and some species are actually quite prolific.
the plants have some interesting adaptations.

### stressor, sparse, is subject to, swing,
There are still a lot of stressors on the desert fringe. The rain there is sparse, right?

the desert fringe is subject to extreme termperature swings, and these conditions can cause plants a lot of stress.

### dry air->rapid evaporation,  hold on to <- take in, pore, be able to and have the ability to, accumulate .<- taken from
becase of the dry air, there's rapid evaporation, so it is difficult for the plant to hold on to the water they take in.

I *read some plants are actually* able to  determine when they've lost enough moisture and have the ability to close their pores so they don't lose more.

.. so they can accumulate water taken from the deep in the ground.
