Dangling modifier
The subordinate phrase to achieve good performance for class imbalance problems while maintaining simplicity does not appear to be modifying the subject the minority class and informative samples. Rewrite the sentence to avoid a dangling modifier.

Modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the nouns they modify. A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that attempts to modify a noun that isn’t actually in the sentence. Sometimes, the target noun does appear in the sentence but is too far away, which results in the modifier getting attached to the wrong noun. In the following examples, the subordinate clause and the subject are in bold to illustrate how one modifies the other.

DyS Approach \cite{lin2013dynamic} pointed out that to achieve good performance for class imbalance problems while maintaining simplicity, the minority class and informative samples should be emphasized.

incredible Origami: 95 amazing paer-folding projects
Sea creatures

origami models often share the same folds and basic designs, known as "bases".
### crease, beak, diagonal, blints, horizontal, vertical (no rule of stress with -al), phase(face but -z), waterbomd, organ(part of organism, eg. heart or liver), bodice(the part of a woman's dress (excluding sleeves) that is above the waist.), pleat(a double or multiple fold in a garment or other item made of cloth, held by stitching the top or side.) 
- mountain fold (the crease is pointing up at you), valley fold (away from), inside reverse fold (make a nose or a tail, or flatten the shape of part of your model), outside reverse fold (make a head, beak, or foot, or another part of your model that sticks out)
- kite base (in half diagonally - meet the middle crease), blints base (two diagonal valley folds, bottom point up to the middle, repeat step 2 with three remaining points)
- fish base (kite - valley fold the top left/right corners - open up one of the corners,take hold of the inside flap, then pull it down to meet the middle crease to make a new flap as shown. - flatten the paper, then do the same on the other side)
- square base (on paper front, make two diagonal valley folds - on paper back, valley fold along the horizontal and vertical lines - hold the paper by opposite diagonal corners. Push the two corners together so that the shape begins to collapse)
- waterbomb base (phase shift of the square base -- push the midpoints of the opposite sides into this shape, so the middle spot pops up.)
- bird base (start with a square base - kite and unfold - take the bottom corner and begin to open out the upper flap by gently pulling up - The paper should open like a bird's beak. Open out the flap as far as it will go - flatten the paper - turn it over and repeat)
- organ base (a large musical instrument having rows of tuned pipes sounded by compressed air, and played using one or more keyboards to produce a wide range of musical effects.) (white side up = back, valley fold the paper in half from top to bottom - vally fold from left to right, crease well, and then unfold - valley fold the left side into the middle, right side too - unfold one flap the stick up - press top down to flatten the left side - repeat the same steps on the right side)
- origami fashion folds:
- step fold (the step fol crease a zigzag, or step, in the paper. It is used to divide different parts of a garment, such as the skirt and bodice of a dress)
- pleat fold (once you have mastered a step fold, making a pleat is esay. In the origami fashion chapter, step folds are always horizontal and pleats are vertical. A pleat fold uses some creases that been made in earlier steps) (to make the first side of a pleat, pinch the crease shown between your fingers.)

##### pouches, cheeks
- Sea creatures: seal(fish), dolphin(waterbomb).  make a wonderful origami underwater world, from a graceful dolphin to a dangerous ray with a sting in its tail!!
- farm animals: rabbit, horse(fish). make these lovely origami animals - from a cute pig to a rooster with a beautiful tail.  ird(kite)
