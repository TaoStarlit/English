our CS group: In his recent book Dying for a Paycheck, Stanford University organizational behavior professor Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that some 150,000 deaths in the United States each year, and as many as 1 million in China, can be attributed to overwork. Sedentary lifestyles, sleeplessness, and stress—all provoked by damaging work cultures and economic anxieties—are partly to blame. ... Work provides the means to live, but it's increasingly clear that the modern workplace can kill, too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_machine#Dynamic_structures
A committee machine is a type of artificial neural network using a divide and conquer strategy in which the responses of multiple neural networks (experts) are combined into a single response.[1] The combined response of the committee machine is supposed to be superior to those of its constituent experts. Compare with ensembles of classifiers.

One of the major advantages of ME is that it is flexible
enough to be combined with a variety of different models. It has been combined with SVM [12]–[14] to partition the input space and to allocate different kernel functions for different input regions, which would not be possible with a single SVM. Recently, ME has been combined with GPs to make them accommodate nonstationary covariance and noise. A single GP has a fixed covariance matrix, and its solution typically requires the inversion of a large matrix. With the mixture of GP experts model [6], [7], the computational complexity of inverting a large matrix can be replaced with several inversions of smaller matrices, providing the ability to solve larger scale datasets. ME has also been used to make an HMM with time-varying transition probabilities that are conditioned on the input [4], [5].

不大懂：gating network 里，Wgk 这里的参数规模是 R^{nxd} 即输入时是训练数据的维度c，输出是expert个数。 
新的文章是这样说的。

但是旧的文章， gating的参数  p_i^c,感觉一个c样本，就需要一组p

所以参数规模是 nxdxC,  C样本的总个数

回答，就的文章，讲的是gating的训练结果 p_i^c: nxC，不是拥有的参数 W nxd.
gate的输入是  Cxd，经过 W nxd之后呢 就是  nxC, 而这个映射过程就是用 W nxd了，就像设计一个神经网络，我有这个 d-y的映射能力，而网络节点是保存这个映射关系是对整体分布的训练，不是对特定样本的训练。    -- 但是多任务，还整体分布？？

Dangling modifier
The subordinate phrase to achieve good performance for class imbalance problems while maintaining simplicity does not appear to be modifying the subject the minority class and informative samples. Rewrite the sentence to avoid a dangling modifier.

Modifiers should be placed as close as possible to the nouns they modify. A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that attempts to modify a noun that isn’t actually in the sentence. Sometimes, the target noun does appear in the sentence but is too far away, which results in the modifier getting attached to the wrong noun. In the following examples, the subordinate clause and the subject are in bold to illustrate how one modifies the other.

DyS Approach \cite{lin2013dynamic} pointed out that to achieve good performance for class imbalance problems while maintaining simplicity, the minority class and informative samples should be emphasized.

incredible Origami: 95 amazing paer-folding projects
Sea creatures

origami models often share the same folds and basic designs, known as "bases".
### crease, beak, diagonal, blints, horizontal, vertical (no rule of stress with -al), phase(face but -z), waterbomd, organ(part of organism, eg. heart or liver), bodice(the part of a woman's dress (excluding sleeves) that is above the waist.), pleat(a double or multiple fold in a garment or other item made of cloth, held by stitching the top or side.) 
- mountain fold (the crease is pointing up at you), valley fold (away from), inside reverse fold (make a nose or a tail, or flatten the shape of part of your model), outside reverse fold (make a head, beak, or foot, or another part of your model that sticks out)
- kite base (in half diagonally - meet the middle crease), blints base (two diagonal valley folds, bottom point up to the middle, repeat step 2 with three remaining points)
- fish base (kite - valley fold the top left/right corners - open up one of the corners,take hold of the inside flap, then pull it down to meet the middle crease to make a new flap as shown. - flatten the paper, then do the same on the other side)
- square base (on paper front, make two diagonal valley folds - on paper back, valley fold along the horizontal and vertical lines - hold the paper by opposite diagonal corners. Push the two corners together so that the shape begins to collapse)
- waterbomb base (phase shift of the square base -- push the midpoints of the opposite sides into this shape, so the middle spot pops up.)
- bird base (start with a square base - kite and unfold - take the bottom corner and begin to open out the upper flap by gently pulling up - The paper should open like a bird's beak. Open out the flap as far as it will go - flatten the paper - turn it over and repeat)
- organ base (a large musical instrument having rows of tuned pipes sounded by compressed air, and played using one or more keyboards to produce a wide range of musical effects.) (white side up = back, valley fold the paper in half from top to bottom - vally fold from left to right, crease well, and then unfold - valley fold the left side into the middle, right side too - unfold one flap the stick up - press top down to flatten the left side - repeat the same steps on the right side)
- origami fashion folds:
- step fold (the step fol crease a zigzag, or step, in the paper. It is used to divide different parts of a garment, such as the skirt and bodice of a dress)
- pleat fold (once you have mastered a step fold, making a pleat is esay. In the origami fashion chapter, step folds are always horizontal and pleats are vertical. A pleat fold uses some creases that been made in earlier steps) (to make the first side of a pleat, pinch the crease shown between your fingers.)

But I prefer to find a student study in UTS or near (another mate is studying in TAFE, which is also suitable)) and that why I'd like to share house with you . （-- 你也许更适合） 
In that way, we can help each other and figure life/study out (figure life out 是从对方的自我介绍里找到的).  （-- 点明双方需求匹配）

I notice your move date is 18th August, which seems to be urgent. Our flat still has one temporary vacancy before our move date (7th-Sep), perhaps you can make it here, and then live in the room you like the most in our fate on 7th-Sep. （-- 乐意提供帮助）

What time is available for you? I will also stay in our office in UTS until about 9 pm. (-- 正题 联系面谈了)
