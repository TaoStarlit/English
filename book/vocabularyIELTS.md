# Unit 6 Effective communication:
### 0725 6a
1. When I *first started to* learn the English, I **really struggled with** it. I don't really *have a problem with* the pronunciation like the other students in my class. I **was just overwhelmed by all of the vocabulary**. But **I persevered and soon I was scoring ten out of ten** in all the tests.
2. **By the time I got to university**, I could produce essay and translated 18 century texts without much difficulty, and I actually enjoyed learning the grammar rules. Then, as part of my university course, I had to go to and live in France for a year. **That's when I learned that** communication is more important than accuracy.
3. *As soon as I arrived I realize* I didn't know how to order the type of coffee I liked and **trying to find accommondation** was a nightmare.
4. I could see **there was no point in just knowing words if you can't** hold a conversation with a native speaker. Fluency is what helps you to function properly - it's what helps you get a job, hold a conversation or just buy the things you need.
- when I first started to ..., I really struggle with it
- I don't really have problem with the xxx, just like other xx. I was just overwhelmed by all of the xxxx.
- By the time I got xxxx, i could xx, and I really enjoyed xx
- As part of my xx course, I had to xxx.  That's when i learned that xx
- As soon as I arrived I realized (\simequ learned) I didn't know how to, and trying xx was a nightmare
- I could see (after realizing problem, I know the principle) there was no point in just doing xx if you can't hold a conversation with a native speaker.
- Fluency is what helps you to function properly. it is what helps you get a job, xxx ,xxx or xx.
- persevere

# Unit 21
1. Try to use a monolingual (not bilinguial) dictionary because this will help practise your English more.
2. a good dictionary will give you example sentences.
3. don't use your dictionary to look up every new word. When you using this book use the context to work out the meaning of a word. Use your dictionary when you have finished.
4. when you are writing, use your dictionary to help with spelling as well as the correct usage of a word.

# Unit 24 task 2  one opinion, do you agree or disagree? 
## there is some thing you and do to imporve your writing
A lot of students find it difficult to write good essays. There is little that you can do to make your essays better or to make job easier.
## paraphase: title VS the begining VS the conclusion
#### replace the words:
a lot of -> many; find it difficult to-> struggle to;  write a good essay -> produce high quality essay;  make sth better -> improve sth;  make the job easier -> make the work less difficult  (you replace the difficult by struggle, now you can use difficult again)
#### paraphrase:
find it adj. to do sth; --> think doing sth. is adv. adj. \ There is little --> There is something / are things. \ make better + make easier --> improve their writing skills. \ Personally, I believe if you want to ... then you need to. Finally, you need to
### struggle to, thoroughly
It is true that many students struggle to write a high quality essay. But I do not agree there is little they can do to improve their essays or to make the task less difficult.

To sum up, even though many students think writing essays is quite difficult. There is still something they can do to improve their writing skills. Personally, I believe if you want to get a high score in an exam situation then you need to make sure that you approch the essay question in a logical and organised way. Finally, you need to leave enough time to check over your work thoroughly at the end. (and nurture your writing ability from pratice, making mistakes and refining your skills.)


## Linking words
