2. a good dictionary will give you example sentences.
3. don't use your dictionary to look up every new word. When you using this book use the context to work out the meaning of a word. Use your dictionary when you have finished.

# Unit 24 task 2  one opinion, do you agree or disagree? 
## there is some thing you and do to imporve your writing
A lot of students find it difficult to write good essays. There is little that you can do to make your essays better or to make job easier.

#### replace the words:
a lot of -> many; find it difficult to-> struggle to;  write a good essay -> produce high quality essay;  make sth better -> improve sth;  make the job easier -> make the work less difficult  (you replace the difficult by struggle, now you can use difficult again)
#### paraphrase:
find it adj. to do sth; --> think doing sth. is adv. adj. \ There is little --> There is something / are things. \ make better + make easier --> improve their writing skills. \ Personally, I believe if you want to ... then you need to. Finally, you need to
### struggle to, thoroughly
It is true that many students struggle to write a high quality essay. But I do not agree there is little they can do to improve their essay or make the work less difficult.

Although a lot of students think writing an good essay is quite difficult. There is still something they can do to improve there writing skills. Personally, I believe if you want to get a high score in the writing then you need make sure you have approch all the required point in the title in a logical and smooth way. Finally, I need to check your work and nurture your writing ability from pratice, making mistakes and refining your skills.
