Essay A:

These days, when you turn on the TV or brown the website, you will know about victims of crime. There is no doubt that criminals must be punished to give the fair to the victims, but what is the effective way of the punishment. Many people believe a prison sentence is the best way, while an increasing number of people say we must consider the specific situation of the crime. In this essay, I will see the both sides of them and give my opinion -- regarding the crime case by case.

It is the belief of many people that the prison is the effective way to punish the criminal in many aspects. They say taking the freedom away from the criminals can protect other people and their possessions because the criminals would no longer touch the community if they were arrested into jail. What is more, some feel that the prison can rehabilitate the criminals. A good example could be a shoplifter. He or she steal something in the shop and is sentenced into the prison where he or she has to study and does work during that period. As a result, this former shoplifter can find a job after being set free into the society and will never re-offend.

On the other hand, a growing number of people consider the age and the type of crime. They claim prison is not a proper place for young criminals because these young can be students, and the prison sentence eventually do harm to their education. What is worse, in the prison, if the students spent time with other criminals such as robbers, murderers and other violent criminals, they would re-offend worse after they are released because they had lost their education and school friends. As for financial crime, people believe this type of criminals should pay money as a fine first and must be restrained in the most of the financial activities they involve in, instead of going to jail.

To sum up, some people think the prison can be helpful for the society and even to criminals, while more and more people believe we should take the certain situation into account. As for me, although the prison sentence is an essential way to punish the criminals, we should regard the crime case by case.

Essay B:

These days, when you turn on the TV or brown the website, you will know about victims of crime. There is no doubt that criminals must be punished to give the fair to the victims, but what is the effective way of the punishment. Some people believe a prison sentence is the best way. I completely disagree with this opinion and I think we should consider the crime case by case. In this essay, I will support my opinion with example.

Firstly, we must take the age of criminal into account. The prison is not a proper place for young criminals. For example, these young can be students, and the prison sentence eventually do harm to their education. What is worse, in the prison, if the students spent time with other criminals such as robbers, murderers and other violent criminals, they would re-offend worse after they are released because they had lost their education and school friends. 

Another reason why I disagree is that prison sentence is not the effective way to all types of crime. Take financial crime as example. Instead of going to jail, this type of criminals should pay money as a fine first and must be restrained in the most of the financial activities they involve in. In some cases, financial criminals are able to commit more crime during the prison period if their account is not locked and under monitor. As for some serious violent criminals and murderers, capital punishment is the best way to send warning message to other would-be criminals. 

On the other hand, there is an argument that the prison is the effective way to punish the criminal in many aspects. They say taking the freedom away from the criminals can protect other people and their possessions because the criminals would no longer touch the community if they were arrested into jail. What is more, some feel that the prison can rehabilitate the criminals. A good example could be a shoplifter. He or she steal something in the shop and is sentenced into the prison where he or she has to study and does work during that period. As a result, this former shoplifter can find a job after being set free into the society and will never re-offend.

In conclusion, although the prison can be helpful for the society and even to criminals, we should take the certain situation into account. Personally, I believe the prison sentence is an good way to punish the criminals only in some cases, we should regard the crime case by case.
