Essay A:
### Paragraph 1
These days, when you turn on the TV or browse the website, you will learn about victims of crime. There is no doubt that criminals must be punished to give back justice to the victims, but what is the best effective punishment. Many people believe a prison sentence is the best way, while an increasing number of people say we must consider the specific situation of the crime. In this essay, I will see the both sides of them and give my opinion -- regarding the crime case by case.
#### Note 1:
1. typo in word ending. brown --> browse I didn't found when read it loud, because I didn't pay attention (not sure z or s) to the word ending in reading;
2. definite article: fair --> justice, but since it is an uncountable noun, not a specific thing, so you cannot use the definite article preceding it.   multi links: A contrast (B => C)
3. definite article: the victims --> should I use the definite article? (countable and plural). yes, you have mentioned learn about victims of crime.
4. definite article: In "the effective way of the punishment" and "regarding the crime case by case", these definite articles make reader confused, do you mean specific objects? but I can not imagine what they area. For example, "I like to go to restaurant, hamburgers are delicious" -- we don't know what kind of hamburgers you refer to, so there is no article here.  "I like to go to McDonald’s, the hamburgers are delicious" -- you have mentioned McDonald’s, so I can imagine what the hamburgers look like. They are specific, so the definite article precedes hamburgers.
5. Collocation: learn about, heard about ~~know about~~
6. Collocation: analyze/investigate both sides of the argument   ~~see the both sides of the~~ not clear if you use them
7. non article collocation:  their, his, my.  how about both?  either the A or the B
8. repetition: -ment and way --> the best effective punishment;   but way/method
9. "Regarding the crime case by case" what do you mean?  -- I learn the recording: they do it so fast, it's indiscernible to us when we're watching the game.  -- But they don't respond indiscernibly.  in speaking we stress *not indiscernibly* by the volume, but in writing, it can be easy to be misunderstood to be *not respond*. -- the not is for the verb or the adverb

Approach/way/method in google dictionary   
1. we need a whole new approach to the job. --- a way of dealing with a situation or problem.
2. I hated their way of cooking potatoes. --- a method, style, or manner of doing something; an optional or alternative form of action.
3. a method for software maintenance.  --- a particular procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.
4. collocation? is doing or is to do?    
    - a way to mitigate this problem is : to do / doing.
    - a way of punishing xx   or  a way to punish xx

### paragraph 2, stand 1
It is a common belief that the prison sentence is an effective way to punish the criminal in many aspects. Many people say taking the freedom away from the criminals can protect other people and their possessions because the criminals would no longer roam free in their community if the criminals were arrested into jail. What is more, some feel that the prison can rehabilitate the criminals. A good example of this could be a shoplifter. He or she steals something in the shop and is sentenced into the prison where he or she has to study and does work during that period. As a result, this former shoplifter can find a job with the working experience after being set free into the society and will never re-offend.
#### note 2, stand 2:
1. indefinite article: ~~the belief of many people~~ --> a common belief. But what if I keep 'many people'?     
2. definite article VS possessive pronoun: touch the community --> roam free in their community? can *the* replace *their*
3. a shoplifter VS shoplifters?  is it only: he or she --> they ? -- but here, criminals, people and shoplifters can use they to refer to, which is very confusing, so the optimal solution of mine: the criminals VS people(they/their) VS shoplifter(he/she)
4. in the last whole example, I use present simple tense, *can* and *will* to demonstrate the process from committing crime, being arrested to being set free. What is the difference from present simple tense, *could* and *should*?
5. the word common implies many people, so don't add many people

### Paragraph3:
On the other hand, a growing number of people consider the age of criminals and the type of crime. They claim prison is not a proper place for young criminals because these young can be students, and the prison sentence eventually do harm to their education. What is worse, in the prison, if the students spent time with other criminals such as robbers, murderers and other violent criminals, they would re-offend worse after they were released because they had lost their education and school friends. As for financial crime, people believe this type of criminals should pay money as a fine first and must be restrained from the most of financial activities they were involved in, instead of going to the jail.
####Note 3:
1. in 3rd sentence, here I use past simple tense and *would*. -- I use subjunctive mood whicexpresses a condition which is doubtful or not factual, because the young inmates can also spend time with other better criminal, and what I wrote is only an extreme situation. 
2. after they are --> they were. I think it should be past simple tense too. And to express the past of it, I used past perfect tense.
3. be restrained in --> be restrained from
4. __ most of __ financial activities, jail: having mentioned financial, so use the, most of do have the.  X:no article preceding  financial activities, because the reader can not imagine what they are.  the jail, have mentioned it.
5. involve: this job involves a lot of travelling.  A lot of travelling is involved in this job. a lot of can qualify the uncountable noun.  -- activities they were involved in.
6. this type of criminals, this type of criminal, these tppe of criminals, which one among the 3?  ---P74 essential words: many big cites have an underground rail systems as their cenerpiece
7. pronunciation: passive struct, positive pole, pessimistic, oOotic pessimist Ooost

### Last paragraph
To sum up, some people think the prison can be helpful for the society and even for the criminals, while more and more people believe we should take the certain circumstances into account. As for me, although the prison sentence is an essential way to punish the criminals, we should consider the particular situation of the crime carefully.
#### Note:
1. definite article: because society/criminals/crime/situation are mentioned before.
2. paraphrase in last sentence:  the certain circumstances --> particular situation : I am not sure about single or plural

## Essay B:
### paragraph 1
These days, when you turn on the TV or brown the website, you will learn about victims of crime. There is no doubt that criminals must be punished to give back justice to the victims, but what is the most effective punishment. Some people believe a prison sentence is the best way. I completely disagree with this opinion and I think we should consider the particular situation of the crime. In this essay, I will support my opinion with example.

Firstly, we must take the age of criminals into account. The prison is not a proper place for young criminals. For example, these young can be students, and the prison sentence eventually does harm to their education. What is worse, in the prison, if the students spent time with other criminals such as robbers, murderers and other violent criminals, they would re-offend worse after they were released because they had lost their education and school friends. 

Another reason why I disagree is that the prison sentence is not an effective way for all types of crime. Take financial crime as example. Instead of going to jail, this type of criminals should pay money as a fine first and must be restrained from the most of financial activities they were involved in. In some cases, financial criminals are able to commit more crime during the prison period if their account is not locked and under monitor. As for some serious violent criminals and murderers, capital punishment is the best way to send warning message to other would-be criminals. 
#### Note:
1. method for software maintain -> here way for all types of crime
2. under monitor VS under the monitor?? If this facility is particular person’s action
3. not for all types, or not for any type ??
4. this type of criminals, this type of criminal, these tppe of criminals, which one among the 3?


On the other hand, there is an argument that the prison is an effective way to punish the criminal in many aspects. They say taking the freedom away from the criminals can protect other people and their possessions because the criminals would no longer touch the community if the criminals were arrested into jail. What is more, some feel that the prison can rehabilitate the criminals. A good example could be a shoplifter. He or she steals something in the shop and is sentenced into the prison where he or she has to study and does work during that period. As a result, this former shoplifter can find a job with the working experience after being set free into the society and will never re-offend.

In conclusion, although the prison can be helpful for the society and even to the criminals, we should take the certain circumstances into account. Personally, I believe the prison sentence is one good way to punish the criminals only in some cases, and we should consider the particular situation of the crime.
