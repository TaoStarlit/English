## what mistakes you have made, the correct one:
- stuff - thing/material   -- staff - all the people in a organization (music staff is organized)
- designate Ooo, the second syllable is z
- semitone Ooo; hemisphere; Oooo
- component pitches:  com- oOo as adj : compulsory vs compulsive != permanent Ooo
- transposition vs transportation   :  position sport

紫竹调 先学。 这几首 王者Bb 精灵镇c 真新c 闻人d 菱纱c 先看音程   D调笛子 低音5高音6；  F调：Bb低音2高音3 C低音1高音2

玉水(可行)：用F调笛子 筒音1  六个孔 开闭分别是 C D E F G A B， 音程C-1 ->D+1
整首最低的音是 此中侠客道 2353 D-1；  偏高: 一笑AG  红衣翩 635A-1DG 正在天之南 2356532 A;  最高: 且听千里春风共含笑123561323 AC+1EDE， C+ 如筒音5的高音5，只开第六孔

紫竹（本来世C，现用D调笛也可）： 叠音就是极快的上倚音，打音是极快的下倚音
王者 最低音D,3; 最高音G+1,6。 第二遍转C调，最低音E，3 最高音A+1,6。G起调，前面可以历音。

1 紫竹最民族特色， 2 玉水扩展性好；3 王者再看Bb,很短周末非常快的。 就这三首！！ 别改，玉水可以直接转正常笛子

### from the book:
- music staff: The music staff has 5 lines and 4 spaces where notes and rests are written.  what are rests
- ledger lines: ~ extend the music staff. Notes on ledger lines can above or below the staff.

All Cs from C1 to C7 inclusive. About this sound Play (help·info).
In music, a pitch class (p.c. or pc) is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. "The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position."

chongchong piano - you and find most of the sheet music of Gujian2.  
- canghaifeichen: C major
- zuiliuxia: D (C# F#) and F (Bb)major
- xinghetaosheng: A (C# F# G#)major
- saixiaqu: D (C# F#) major
- zhegutian: D (C# F#) major
- gaoshanliushui: A (C# F# G#) or C->Eb (Ab Bb Eb) 

music:
flute -- transposition
Because of the physical properties of certain instruments, it’s easier to transpose and read sheet music for them in a different key rather than read them in concert pitch (like a piano).

if you we regared C-G dizi as the comoponent pitches of  G major and F major, then we find G major has one sharp, and F major has one flat.   For C flute F major the 4 need flat. For G major the 7 need sharp(open all the holes).

G major:
- Relative key	E minor
- Parallel key	G minor
- Dominant key	D major
- Subdominant	C major
- Component pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, F♯

G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F♯. Its key signature has one sharp, F♯. Its relative minor is E minor and its parallel minor is G minor.


F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B♭, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat: B♭. Its relative minor is D minorand its parallel minor is F minor. The enharmonic equivalent, E♯ major, has four double-sharps, which makes it impractical to use.

only F major and C major has equivalnent major (B# is equivalent to C major), because the pitch interval only semi-tone for B->C and E->F.
