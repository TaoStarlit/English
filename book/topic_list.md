flute -- transposition
Because of the physical properties of certain instruments, it’s easier to transpose and read sheet music for them in a different key rather than read them in concert pitch (like a piano).

if you we regared C-G dizi as the comoponent pitches of  G major and F major, then we find G major has one sharp, and F major has one flat.   For C flute F major the 4 need flat. For G major the 7 need sharp(open all the holes).

G major:
- Relative key	E minor
- Parallel key	G minor
- Dominant key	D major
- Subdominant	C major
- Component pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, F♯

G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F♯. Its key signature has one sharp, F♯. Its relative minor is E minor and its parallel minor is G minor.


F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B♭, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat: B♭. Its relative minor is D minorand its parallel minor is F minor. The enharmonic equivalent, E♯ major, has four double-sharps, which makes it impractical to use.

only F major and C major has equivalnent major (B# is equivalent to C major), because the pitch interval only semi-tone for B->C and E->F.
