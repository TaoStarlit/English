# Unit 3 Crime
### before you study this this unit, try to writing the essay on the topic: prison is the best punishment for criminals.
2:1 it depends on, take xx into account.  introduction: need statement

For crime issue, some people believe the best way to punish criminals is prison, and others do not think so. In opinion, prison is only the most essential way of punishing the criminals, <u/>but it should take into account of the age and the type of the one with crime. <u/> and there should be more effective way depending on the age and the type of the person with crime. This essay will first discuss about the prison punishment. Then it will analyse its deficience and alternative punishment way. In this essay, I will shared my opinion as well as examples.

Prison is a basic way to to punish the crimals as it can take the freedom of the crimals and protect other from these crimals for a while. Obviously, the crimal who is be confined in the prison can do harm to other people in the sociaty, so other people can enjoy their normal without the interence of these crimal. For example, when a theif is taken into the prison, others' possesions will be safer, an they are not expured to the theif. Moreover, in the prison, the crimal can be rehabited to be a worker, and after they are released, they can to get a simple job of worker and will not be back to be a theif any more. Prison is good way to transfer the crimal to be good guy as well as to protect other people.

Having said that, prison is a good punishment only in some cases. For teenagers, if by chance they become a crimal and are taken into the prison, they can't to go to school for the elementary education. What's worse, if other crimals shape the personality to be worse, and then after they go out of the prison, they may do more crimes, which make the sociality more unsafe. For some financial criminals, even in the prison, they can continue to make more crime if they are able to communicate with their partners and operate the financal tool. Therefore, prison is not always a good punishment.

For the criminals, the kind of punishment should depend on the type of the crime and the age of the criminals. The students who have slight crimes should provide community service as punishment. By this way, they can be aware of their role and reponsibility in the sociaty as well as go to school for further education like their classmates. For some criminals who stole the tax or made illegal transactions, they should repay the money and their bank account must be locked. And even after they return to the sociaty, their permission must be restricted, like international travel and founding a new company. For servious crimals, I think it must be more than prison as the punishment.

In conclusion, I think prison is not the best way for all crimal, and the best punishment way should take the age of criminals and the type of crime into account. Prison is only the basic punshment in some case, and there should be a serial punishment case by case. More importantly, I believe good education and social policy will reduce the criminal events.

## each paraphraph: cause + solution
1. One cause of stress in modern life is that people work long hours. In many jobs, workers have to work for 10-12 hours a day, which means they come home late and do not have time to relax or spend time with their family with their family. For instance, in many Asian countris, the average office workers has to start work very early, and doesn't come back home until 9 or 10 p.m. +. A solution is for the goverment to bring law to limit the number of hours a person can work in one day. -- modern life
1. Another cause of stress is job insecurity. In the past, most employees had a permanent contract and did not worry too much about losing their jobs. However, nowadays, it is common for people to work on short-term contract which just lasts a few months or one year. This means they are often worried about what will happen to them at the end of the contract. + This problem could be addressed by goverment making companies give longer-term contracts to all their employees.
