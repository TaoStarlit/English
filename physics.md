### Unit and Measurements
#### Philosophy and Pratice in science
- philosophy, vital, planet, orbit, invent, arrest
	1. philosophy, technology (Oo-gy/phy): the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.
	1. vital: absolutely important. full of energy; lively;  
	1. orbit: or with r is stressed
	1. invent, arrest:  oO
	1. Experiment play a vital part in the development of all branches of sciences.
	1. Philosophy and practice in science:
	1. Galileo used the newly invented telescope to observe the motion of the moons of Jupiter.
	1.  Galileo was arrested when he published his evidence for the Copernican view of the Universe.



- Originate, astronomer, steady, in favor of, presence, low-intensity, radiation, disprove
	1. originate:  (Oo.nate) have a specified beginning. 
	1. astronomer: (astronomy: as-Ooo) an expert in or student of astronomy.
	1. steady:  (dad) firmly fixed; supported. 
	1. presence:  (noun Oo) the state or fact of existing, occurring, or being present in a place or thing.  
	1. intensity (the quality of being intense.), intense (of extreme force, degree, or strength. adj.), intensive (concentrated on a single area or subject or into a short time; very thorough or vigorous.)  all:  in-Ooo
	1. radiation (the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves), disprove (prove that (something) is false.)
	1. Scientists now believe the Universe originated in a massive explosion, referred to as the Big Bang.
	1. The steady state theory was rejected in favor of the Big Bang | when astronomers discovered the presence of low-intensity microwave radiation in all directions <- in space radiation that originated in the Big Bang which is still traveling through space.
	1.  just one experiment is all that is needed to disprove a theory. -- The more experimental tests that are found to support a theory, the stronger that the theory becomes.


- therm, whereas, supplied by, derive, kilowatt, specified/specific
	1. therm (these): a unit of heat equivalent to 100,000 Btu or 1.055 Ã— 10^8 joules.
	1.  supply, supplied, apply, applied (oO)
	1. kilowatt: (Oo, o)
	1. derive: (de-O) obtain something from (a specified source).
	1. specified(Oo, fy. defined), specific(O-fic. precise)
	1. Energy supplied by gas is measured in therms, whereas energy supplied by electricity is in kilowatt hours.
	1. Units of all other quantities are derived from the S.I. base unit.

- square meter,  volume, cubic meter, ampere, kelvin, abbreviated to, Numberical, decimal, ternary from, exception, prefix
	1.  volume: the amount of space that a substance or object occupies
	1. cubic: having the shape of a cube
	1. ampere: (am- pair) a unit of electric current equal to a flow of one coulomb per second.
	1. kelvin: the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature, equal in magnitude to the degree Celsius.  attitude: Oo-tude
	1. abbreviate: (Oo, ate) shorten (a word, phrase, or text).
	1. numeric, numerical: (oO-ric -rical, O: set) relating to or expressed as a number or numbers. -- the same meanings
	1. decimal (possible Oo-al/ble): relating to or denoting a system of numbers and arithmetic based on the number ten, tenth parts(1/10), and powers of ten.
	1. ternary: (factory) composed of three parts.
	1. prefix: (Oo: previous)  a word, letter, or number placed before another.
	1. ampere: the standard unit of electric current is ampere.
	1. cubic, abbreviated to:  The unit of volume/area is the cubic/square meter, abbreviated to m^3/m^2
	1. Numerical values smaller than 0.001 and greater than 1000 are usually expressed in standard form for convenience.
	1. The numerical value is written as a number between 1 and 10, multiplied by an appropriate power of ten corresponding to how many places the decimal point is moved until the number is between 1 and 10(2 power of 10).
	1. Engineers usually express numerical values in the ternary form where the power of 10 is a multiple of 3 (i.e. 10^3, 10^6, etc.)
	1. These are used to avoid unwieldy numerical values. The most common numerical prefixes are (gigabyte, megabyte, kilometer, millimeter micrometer, nanometer:   all are Oo, meter, and the 2nd syllable is light sound e like kilo)
	1. wieldy: easily controlled or handled.
	1. radius (calculus, Ooo) The mean radius of the earth is 6360000 m. The decimal point after final zero needs to be moved (noun as adv) six places to the left arrive at 6.36 (needs to be moved xx places to arrive at xx  )
	1. the answer to a calculation should always be to the same number of significant figures as the data supplied. A numerical answer should, therefore, be rounded up or round down to match the number of significant figures of the data supplied.
