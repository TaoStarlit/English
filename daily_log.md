   - and more originating reason, I didn't write it on the paper

1. is this article good for you? https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/article-abstract/9/18/101/2392430?redirectedFrom=fulltext
2. journal doesn't have deadline, except special issue

3. you must get the opportunity, or everything will fail!! Be nice, tolerant to your girl, there are no equal!!
    1. want to welcome, but still refuse. You should know this natural! using your courage, wise and tolerant!!


before the moment you moved in, the water facility was leak and block, and after the moment you moved out the electriciy broken. These let think of you are very special.

not interfere damage the property or bring trouble to others anymore, you can only bring some surprise in my house or flat.

1. Timetable:
IJCAI deadline Feb-25, so time table:
Jan. finish writing; 
Dec. complete all the experiment; 
Nov. literature reviews ---- it is next month, so it also help the writing of TNNLS, as I can learn how some good papers were written.

2. difference:
Another issue is what differences among IJCAI(more sponsor from China),AAAI,ICDM(should be similar to KDD),TNNLS(it is system level and focus on Neural network), how can I study the differences and make use of them?
From previous learning: some TNNLS or other transaction papers about emerging research topics that are very theoretical the experiments are more systematic(like prof. Yao's style), and NIPS, AAAI, ICDM papers solve certern problems in specific topic, eg. imabalanced image data classification and boundary detection, Improved Gans and some variants of model in specific applications (like your previous instructions).
3. topic and strength:
For the from the final PhD thesis, breaking down to the research topic and one-by-one projects. We should begin with the strength of the panel, supervisors and myself. 
As in Chen's opinion, I have 2 very great supervisors, and myself is also not bad. But for the previous long period, the topic and projects were irrelevant to the strength of supervisors even not to mine. 
The joint-PhD is like a reform for me, the reform should begin with the strength (Learn China's reform v.s. Former Soviet's reform), get some results, and only then be able to turn to key-weakness or other high-valuable and challenging projects.  I found the previous Phd student prof. Yao mentioned is researching online imbalanced learning where both class imbalance and concept drift coexist. 
Therefore, as a long-term topic and one-by-one projects,  I am interested in the combined problem of both imbalanced and transfer learning(it is also relevant to the concept drift). 
If you agree, can you recommend a list of papers in this field? it will be better if they are your student's papers, as it lets the discussion much easier.

1. patience and stamina help me a lot. Don't assume they are bad guy in the first engage because of your over-reaction. Don't send the situmiling information, but double-check what you really need and change it, more polite, or ask question in self-examination manner. Even it is the bad thing you feel, try to ask and comfirm first. if you self-exam well, your question will also let him/her self-exam.
2. face your weakness, the training and tackling it is the easy part once you begin. Although the identify and admit it are the hardest part, if you are strong and wise, it is just a moment.  --- accept and embrace and tackle
3. you learn a lot in telling the stories using the photo. but you still need to learn to refine it.

1. 9:15, so far the problem is only the level set. There are no training set, so it is not the classification or regression problem.   least-square regression is the also quadratic problem? so how is the classificatoin?
    1. ans: yes, eg. problem with 100 variables can be also quadratic as the high power is 2. eg. $x_1^2,x_1,x_{99}, x_{99}^2$
