short presentation overview and sample --- greet, reason,

expression start/close/transition: how important a presentation can be?  part 1, part 2, part 3
    what and why it important
    1. I will xx
    2. why it is important? well, if you do this correctly, your audience you followwhat  you pay attentionto what you say
    3. this means you have much greater chance of selling them your products or services,
    4. getting a job or promotion
    5. or just impress you boss and co-workers with how organized and efficient your presentation. it is pretty good thing, hub

transistion: on the slides, it must have separate points:
    1. don't too smooth, eg. next, next. you need to separate main points
    2. signpost: first, second, third (don't use finally unless in the conclusion)
    3. classic transition: now that we've discussed tents, let's talk about sleeping bags
    4. summary transition (also highlight the postions of the points and the relationships among the points): And that's why tents are the first key component of your camping gear. (pause) Now let's discuss another key piece of gear.  recap A, pause, forecap B
    5. racap previous two points and forecap next topic: tents are the first key component of your camping gear. (pause) A good sleeping bag is the second (pause). let's now discuss how you're going to carry it all.

why it is important. Well, take recommander system as an example. If you predict what movies users want to watch and recommand them, then users will purchase, which is task one. You also need to predict what movies users like and rate, that means afterward let they go back for more movies. If you do these 2 tasks simultaneously and correctly, you will have a much greater chance to sell your movies, earn profits and obtain rewards continuously.
It is a pretty good thing, hub.

But sometimes, in practice, multi-task learning models do not always outperform the corresponding single-task models on all tasks. The reason??


This shared-bottom model is a basic model for multi-task learning problem, since this problem was reached in 1997. Now let's have a look of the recent works of multi-task learning problem.

xx, xx, xx and outperform the basic shared bottom model, but all of they need adding ...
And this paper tries to avoid adding more parameter, the model of this paper is inpired by a classic model, that is Mixture of Experts model.



### problem
? the idea of shared bottom / MoE.  ? learn the way to illustrate following points with proper transitional statements.
1. goal, 
2. approch, 
3. implementation

? a statement: multi-class learning model < single task. + reason??
