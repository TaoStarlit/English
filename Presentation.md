lilsubs.com -- realy impressive


short presentation overview and sample --- greet, reason,
    structure: introduction: greeting, self id, topic, purpose(why I choose this topic), what the main point be?
      
greeting: well come? 
self: as you may already know
purpose: today, I would like to talk to you a little bit about
reason: because I think it is important for students to know something about more deep learning frameworks 
indication time + deal with question: since I've only got about 7 or 8 minutes I won't be able to go into great depth so if you
have any questions I'd be happy to answer at the end of presentation

scope or outline:
so given these time limits I've chosen just two things to
talk about. firstly I'll briefly introduce this topic
secondly I'd like to talk about the backgroud of the paper

XX dealing with difficult terms XX
I don't think I'll be using any difficult terms ... leave your question to the end of presentation

transition:
okay well
let's get started the first thing, the introduction. 
The key word of the title, multi-task learning is a subfield of machen learning ...

expanding the point:
this seems quite important to students and I guess there are two possible reasons for this.
firstly it's because they're curious to know about their teachers and lecturers 
and secondly they probably just want to feel confident that they're in the hands of an experienced professional 

(real things) well I don't know about that but I've certainly been around a long time I started
... primary school
as you probably know: primary school teachers are generalists
in other words they teach nearly everything
so: for the first couple of years after graduating from Teachers College I taught in primary schools
(another) after that I went back to university

this xx and brings me to: 1995, when I started xxx  
so that means: I've been here for 18 years 

restaing main point: so hopefully that satisfy your curiousity

transition to 2nd point:
 but of course I don't spend all
my time in teaching and learning believe it or not teachers are human too and need a break from work just like everybody else.
so this brings us to the second thing I'd like to share with you about myself. 
 and that is to tell you about how I spend my spirit or my free time well in a strange sort of way I can't stay away from teaching and learning because I love foreign languages


This seems quite important, there are 3 points for this.
Firstly, it the simplest method for multi-task learning, whose goal is to improve the generation performance.
Secondly, 
Third, for the structure, xxx, which enables the shared bottom model to xx

But, as mention before the task differences will harm the performance, as you know this model does not consider the task differences.





expression start/close/transition: how important a presentation can be?  part 1, part 2, part 3
    - what and why it important
        1. I will xx
        2. why it is important? well, if you do this correctly, your audience you followwhat  you pay attentionto what you say
        3. this means you have much greater chance of selling them your products or services,
        4. getting a job or promotion
        5. or just impress you boss and co-workers with how organized and efficient your presentation. it is pretty good thing, hub
    - part 1 when you begin your topic: OK, so as mentioned(outline) the first thing I'm going to tale about is __.
    - part 2 end your 1st topic: So I think you've now got a good understanding of __ right?
    - part 3 transition to your next part: OK, so let me now move onto the second/next thing/item, which is ___



transistion: on the slides, it must have separate points:
    1. don't too smooth, eg. next, next. you need to separate main points
    2. signpost: first, second, third (don't use finally unless in the conclusion)
    3. classic transition: now that we've discussed tents, let's talk about sleeping bags
    4. summary transition (also highlight the postions of the points and the relationships among the points): And that's why tents are the first key component of your camping gear. (pause) Now let's discuss another key piece of gear.  recap A, pause, forecap B
    5. racap previous two points and forecap next topic: tents are the first key component of your camping gear. (pause) A good sleeping bag is the second (pause). let's now discuss how you're going to carry it all.

### draft
multi-learning xxx
why it is important. Well, take recommander system as an example. If you predict what movies users want to watch and recommand them, then users will purchase, which is task one. You also need to predict what movies users like and rate, that means afterward let they go back for more movies. If you do these 2 tasks simultaneously and correctly, you will have a much greater chance to sell your movies, earn profits and obtain rewards continuously.
It is a pretty good thing, hub.

But sometimes, in practice, multi-task learning models do not always outperform the corresponding single-task models on all tasks. The reason??


This shared-bottom model is a basic model for multi-task learning problem, since this problem was reached in 1997. Now let's have a look of the recent works of multi-task learning problem.

xx, xx, xx and outperform the basic shared bottom model, but all of they need adding ...
And this paper tries to avoid adding more parameter, the model of this paper is inpired by a classic model, that is Mixture of Experts model.



### problem
? the idea of shared bottom / MoE.  ? learn the way to illustrate following points with proper transitional statements.
1. goal, 
2. approch, 
3. implementation

? a statement: multi-class learning model < single task. + reason??
