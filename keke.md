I am a student

<u>How long have you been studying</u> English?

More than six years

That is a long time.

Yeah, I <u>started to learn</u> English <u>when I was in</u> high/middle school?

**No wonder** your English is so good 

Actually, it is not that good. I *can* read but I *can't* speak very well.

I <u>haven't had</u> **a lot of chance** to speak English.

I see, talking with other people is very important. 

yeah, It gives me opportunity to practice the words I learned, so that they can become part of your active words.

Yeah, but I <u>still don't have</u> so many international friends here.

I <u>am having party tonight</u> at my apartment. You *should* come.

Thank you for inviting me. I*'d love to* come.











Dinner invitation 

Are you here for work?

*how long will you be staying*?

4 days. I <u>am going back on</u> Friday.

My brother and I <u>are getting together to have a dinner</u>. *Do you want (*Would you like) to come with us?

That <u>would be</u> nice. I <u>have a meeting in a hour</u>. I *can* meet you *afterwards* (later) if that is ok. The meeting *shouldn't **last** (be) so long*.

Can I use your phone? I left mine in the car, and I have to call them to get the direction 





Hi, Vicky.

Are you there yet?

I *just got off the subway*, sorry I am late.

Study for an exam

after the ielts Masterclass, I know the why the examiner ask in that way  :  ***talk about the future or past, in order to test your tense***

Nice to see you again. *How have you been*?

*Ok, I didn't sleep much last night though*. I *stayed up until 2 am, studying for an exam*. 

I *was up late last night too*. The semester is almost over. I *have had exams* all week.

*Are you going back to* California after you graduate?

Yes, I think so. After *I graduate, I will probably go* home and try to get (find)a job.

**Do you know where you'd like to work**?

Not yet. But I want to be an English translator.

That would be really cool. I'd like to be an English translator too..... than most of my classmates .



I *am going to study* at the library. I *have to take a exam tomorrow*.

Me too. *How late does the library stay open*?

Say / think 

**The reason why I think that is because, you know**,

There

I think the teacher is **the part there that really motivates** students to go further 

~ never

A computer **will never really motivate** you, they *will only tell* if you are doing good or bad, while

-- Tell you. tell you about.    How. What to do

A teacher **can really**, you know, tell you about his or her experience. Tell you what to do to become better.

And they **will give you a hint on** how to improve yourself in a more humane way

Jar, jam

A jar the of oil

Strawberry jam





X: So the correction is do you think the computers can literally take place teacher

So the question is do you think computers can really replace teacher?

That's a good question. No, and why I think that is because you know there are only that much you can make interactive without any discipline.

I think a teacher is the part there that really motivates students to be better. 

As a computer.. he will never motivates you, it can only tell you if you are doing good or bad while a teacher can tell you his or her experience, tell you what to do to be better. They will give you a hint on how to improve yourself in a more humane way
