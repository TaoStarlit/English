#### TRM week2 Statistial Inference
- statisitical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about the entire population based on information in a sample. (make inference about the population parameter)
- critical question: what information does the sample give about the population and how reliable is that information.
- parameter v.s. statistic:  A parameter is a number that describes some aspect of a population. It is the value that we want to know and we hypothesize(make a claim) about.
- A statistic is a number that is computed from data in a sample. It is the value we know and use to make inference (judgement) about the population parameter.  statistics: $\bat x \hat p$, parameter: $\mu p$
- where does inference fit in? Interence provides the tool to test whether our observations can be applied to the population as opposed to seeing the result by change.


- The further away the test statistic is from H0, the more evidence against H0. The closer the test statistic is from H0, the less evidence against H0

- The sampling distribution:
~ is a distribution of sample statistics computed for different samples of the same size from the same population. It tells us how the sample statistic varies from sample to sample and shows us how close the statistic is to the parameter. 
A sampling distribution is created by, as the name suggests, sampling. Sampling reduces the potential of errors in inference since a sample cannot be fully representative of the population.

State the assumption(s) of the test, and justify whether they are valid from the sample. The assumptions are necessary for the test to be valid.

- be unlikely to occur by alone(不可能单独偶然发生)
When results as extreme as the observed sample statistic are unlikely to occur by chance alone(assuming the null hypothesis is true), we say the sample results are statistically significant.

- reject H0 for H1,  consistent with
    1. Evidence against H0, reject H0 for H1
    2. Data is consistent with H0,-- Retain H0

- be accused of doing, guilty/evidence of doing,  exple the student
    1. A high school student is accused of cheating so the principal must investigate whether or not the accusation is true. 
    2. If she finds the student guilty of cheating she will expel the student. If she finds no evidence of cheating the student will be allowed to graduate with their current grade.
- composition of the Earth's atmosphere;  bubble of gas; amber
    1. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has seen some major changes in the past. 
    1. One source of information about these changes is bubbles of gas inside ancient amber, a tree resin that has hardened and been trapped in rocks. 
        - a thin sphere of liquid enclosing air or another gas.
        - hard translucent fossilized resin produced by extinct coniferous trees of the Tertiary period, typically yellowish in color.
        - resin: a sticky flammable organic substance, insoluble in water, exuded by some trees and other plants (notably fir and pine).  气泡，琥珀，树脂 ˈrezən，标本 Ooo: ˈspesəmən
    1. Measurements on specimens from the late Cretaceous era (75 to 95 million years ago) gave these percentages of nitrogen:
        - an individual animal, plant, piece of a mineral, etc., used as an example of its species or type for scientific study or display.   
- violate, nitrogen
    1. Suppose the normality assumption in the data had not been violated. The present value for nitrogen in the air is 78.1%.1

- violate, deem, inappropriate
  1 .Since the normality assumption in the data had been violated and the use of the one sample t-test is deemed inappropriate.....     
    - regard or consider in a specified way.
    - the event was deemed a great success
    - synonym: consider, regard as, judge,
  1. Then carry out the test and answer the question using wilcox.test. 
    - carry out : 
        1. 实行： put through, follow up, implement, go through, follow out, follow through
        1. 完成： fulfill, carry through, accomplish, execute, action
- beneath, Arctic, Antarctic, icecaps, Methane
    1. analysing bubbles from samples of ice from beneath the Arctic and Antarctic icecaps.
    1. Methane values are given in parts per billion (ppb) for several time periods.
